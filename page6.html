			<h1>Problems Encountered</h1>

	The problems that I encounter during the making  of this project is a lot but I think the biggest problem that I face is time management, thinking of the product, concept and the javascript. I really had a hard time managing my time way back even before and I think that is my biggest struggle doing this project. second is I had a hard time thinking of what product should I present and the concept the should go through. Lastly is the javascript I don't have much experience doing javascript and I dont have much connections that knows how to do javascript.
