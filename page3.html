						The first improvise that I want to do to my product is to have all the similar products that the other smart watch has. First of is the body temperature checker. 
Its use is to check and display your body temperature whenever you wear them. It will have a heat sensor on the back for temperature check.
Second is bluetooth and WI-FI connections, all the other smart watch has this so that you have an access to internet or connect to other devices such as speaker, phone, headphones, and other devices.
Next is music, so many of us loves to listen to music and it is also common for a smart watch to have a music player so that you can relax while you do your stuff.
this music player can connect to bluetooth or WI-FI because it has no connector for the headphones in smart watch most of the connection in this product is wireless except the charger.
Next is the gps, this gps can track your location and can guide you to your desired destination.
