						This product that I want to launch is a smart watch and it can do a lot of things similar to a normal smart watch that you see in the present. 
but for a change I invented a smart watch that others may not know about. Usually a smart watch is for sending and receiving messages, checking time, 
listening to music, checking your body tempperature for exercises, connecting to bluetooth, WI-FI, and can access gps and track you down. 
This one that I invented has can do a lot more than that. those capabilities will still be there but I will be adding an interesting feature that 
will sell to any buyer and will surely enjoy.
