						The main feature that I will add to this product is the game feature that can smoothly run in this small screened watch. I tried to think of a game that has a low capacity that can fit into the system of a smart watch.
I came up with a chess game in the smart watch or a basic card game that everyone will love. The details of the game easily understand so that many can appreciate and play. I will also add a call feature to this smart watch product 
so that the people that is using the product can easily communicate to the person they want to communicate. Another idea for the smart watch feature is the camera so that the people that are using this smart watch can take pictures of themselves using these. 
It will also have a screenshot feature incase you want to capture your smart watch screen. Lastly is the alarm feature, all in all this is still a watch so its understandable that this smart watch must have an alarm.
